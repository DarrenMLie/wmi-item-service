### Where's My Item? Item Service

Where's My Item? is a social network mobile app created to help people develop a healthier lifestyle in their shopping
choices and space management by keeping track of what they possess and where the items are, how
much they spent on new items, and comparison of purchase vs discard every month.

### Package structure
The packages are structured according to hexagonal architecture that I learnt from this article: https://medium.com/@matiasvarela/hexagonal-architecture-in-go-cfd4e436faa3
